Claude Skills and Commands for Search Engine Optimization (SEO) and Generative Engine Optimization (GEO). 20 skills, 9 commands, and one shared operating contract. Tool-agnostic, works with or without integrations. Content quality is powered by the [CORE-EEAT Content Benchmark](https://github.com/aaron-he-zhu/core-eeat-content-benchmark). Domain authority is powered by the [CITE Domain Rating](https://github.com/aaron-he-zhu/cite-domain-rating).

> **SEO** gets you ranked in search results. **GEO** gets you cited by AI systems (ChatGPT, Perplexity, Google AI Overviews). This library covers both.

## Quick Start

> Works with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/download), [OpenClaw](https://openclaw.com), [Cursor](https://cursor.com), [Codex](https://openai.com/codex), and [35+ other agents](https://skills.sh). No other dependencies.

1. **Install** — pick the method for your tool:

   | Your tool | Install command |
   |-----------|----------------|
   | **OpenClaw** | `clawhub install aaron-he-zhu/<skill-name>` — [browse all 20](https://clawhub.ai/u/aaron-he-zhu) |
   | **Claude Code** | `/plugin marketplace add aaron-he-zhu/seo-geo-claude-skills` (all 20) |
   | **Cursor / Codex / Windsurf / other** | `npx skills add aaron-he-zhu/seo-geo-claude-skills` (all 20) |

   > All installation methods remain available at all times. If any marketplace is temporarily unavailable, use an alternative method.

   Install a single skill via skills.sh:
   ```bash
   npx skills add aaron-he-zhu/seo-geo-claude-skills -s keyword-research
   ```

   <details>
   <summary>Claude Code Plugin (alternative)</summary>

   ```bash
   # Or load locally
   claude --plugin-dir ./seo-geo-claude-skills
   ```

   Includes `marketplace.json`, `plugin.json`, and pre-configured MCP servers. See [CONNECTORS.md](https://github.com/aaron-he-zhu/seo-geo-claude-skills/blob/main/CONNECTORS.md) for MCP setup.

   ```

4. **Optionally connect tools** — edit [CONNECTORS.md](https://github.com/aaron-he-zhu/seo-geo-claude-skills/blob/main/CONNECTORS.md) to map `~~placeholders` to your toolstack (Ahrefs, SEMrush, Google Analytics, etc.)

## Operating Model

Every skill in this repo now follows the same lightweight contract:

- **Trigger**: when this skill must be the next move
- **Quick Start**: shortest successful invocation
- **Skill Contract**: what the skill reads, writes, and promotes
- **Handoff**: reusable summary for later skills or later sessions
- **Next Best Skill**: one primary follow-up, not a long menu

The four cross-cutting skills form the protocol layer:

- `content-quality-auditor` = publish readiness gate
- `domain-authority-auditor` = citation trust gate
- `entity-optimizer` = canonical entity profile
- `memory-management` = campaign memory loop

Shared references:

- [references/skill-contract.md](https://github.com/aaron-he-zhu/seo-geo-claude-skills/blob/main/references/skill-contract.md)
- [references/state-model.md](https://github.com/aaron-he-zhu/seo-geo-claude-skills/blob/main/references/state-model.md)

### Automation

Prompt-based hooks run automatically during your session — no configuration needed:

- **Session start**: loads your project memory and reminds you of open items
- **After writing content**: recommends a quality audit before publishing
- **Session end**: offers to save findings for next time

### Memory

Three-tier temperature model keeps project context across sessions:

- **HOT** (80 lines, auto-loaded): goals, hero keywords, active veto items
- **WARM** (on-demand): audit summaries, research findings, content plans
- **COLD** (archive): historical data, queried only when needed

Findings promote automatically when referenced frequently. Stale items archive after 90 days.

### Where to Begin

| Your Goal | Start Here | Then |
|-----------|-----------|------|
| Starting from scratch | `keyword-research` → `competitor-analysis` | → `seo-content-writer` |
| Write new content | `keyword-research` | → `seo-content-writer` + `geo-content-optimizer` |
| Improve existing content | `/seo:audit-page <URL>` | → `content-refresher` or `seo-content-writer` |
| Fix technical issues | `/seo:check-technical <URL>` | → `technical-seo-checker` |
| Assess domain authority | `/seo:audit-domain <domain>` | → `backlink-analyzer` |
| Full quality assessment | `content-quality-auditor` + `domain-authority-auditor` | → 120-item combined report |
| Build entity/brand presence | `entity-optimizer` | → `schema-markup-generator` + `geo-content-optimizer` |
| Generate performance report | `/seo:report <domain> <period>` | → periodic monitoring |

## Methodology

Skills are organized into four execution phases plus one protocol layer. Use them in order for new projects, or jump to any phase as needed.

```
 RESEARCH          BUILD            OPTIMIZE          MONITOR

- **domain-authority-auditor** + **backlink-analyzer** → domain authority deep-dive
- **entity-optimizer** + **schema-markup-generator** → complete entity markup
- **memory-management** + any skill → persistent project context

## Inter-Skill Handoff Protocol

When a skill points to its `Next Best Skill`, preserve this context for the next move:

| Context | How to Pass | Example |
|---------|------------|---------|
| Objective | State what was analyzed, created, or fixed | "Objective: refreshed declining pricing page" |
| Key findings / output | Carry forward the highest-signal result | "Key output: GEO section rewrite + publish verdict = fix before ship" |
| Evidence | Include URLs, datasets, or sections reviewed | "Evidence: GSC last 90 days, page URL, competitor SERP snapshot" |
| Open loops | Note blockers, missing inputs, or unresolved risks | "Open loops: missing author bio and current customer proof" |
| Target keyword | Include in the skill invocation | "Run content-refresher for keyword 'cloud hosting'" |
| Content type | State explicitly | "Content type: how-to guide" |
| CORE-EEAT scores | Summarize dimension scores | "Current scores: C:75 O:60 R:80 E:45 — focus on Exclusivity" |
| CITE scores | Summarize dimension + veto status | "CITE: C:82 I:65 T:71 E:58, no veto triggers" |
| Priority items | List specific item IDs | "Priority: improve O08, E07, R06" |
| Content URL | Include for fetch-capable skills | "Analyze https://example.com/page" |

**Memory-managed handoff**: If `memory-management` is active, prior audit results are automatically available via the hot cache in [CLAUDE.md](https://github.com/aaron-he-zhu/seo-geo-claude-skills/blob/main/CLAUDE.md). Skills should check for cached scores before re-running audits.

## Reference Materials

Shared references used by multiple skills:

| Reference | Items | Used by |
|-----------|:-----:|---------|
| [core-eeat-benchmark.md](https://github.com/aaron-he-zhu/seo-geo-claude-skills/blob/main/references/core-eeat-benchmark.md) | 80 | content-quality-auditor, seo-content-writer, geo-content-optimizer, content-refresher, on-page-seo-auditor |
| [cite-domain-rating.md](https://github.com/aaron-he-zhu/seo-geo-claude-skills/blob/main/references/cite-domain-rating.md) | 40 | domain-authority-auditor, backlink-analyzer, competitor-analysis, performance-reporter |

Most skills also include `references/` subdirectories with skill-specific templates, rubrics, and checklists (e.g. http-status-codes, robots-txt, kpi-definitions, report-templates).
